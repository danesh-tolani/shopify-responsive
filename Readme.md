Hi, my name is **Danesh tolani**, and I have prepared Shopify home page clone using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.

This is a static webpage with some subtle transition effects like:

- Button color changes when we hover on the button
- Nav DropDown
- Arrow moves ahead when we hover on that text

This webpage is **Mobile Responsive** as well.

## Deployed Website
